# AppointmentSys

_coursework cs5001_

This is a command-line application that allows users to manage their appointments. Users can create new appointments, cancel existing appointments, check for conflicts, and reschedule appointments as needed. The application also supports user management, allowing administrators to add, delete, and list users.
## Known Issues
As of the latest version, all functionality in the program should be working as intended. However, if any issues are encountered, they may be due to user input errors or unexpected edge cases.
## Future Work
If I had more time to work on this project, I would consider implementing additional error handling and validation checks to ensure that the program can handle any input that the user might provide. Additionally, I would explore options for persisting user and appointment data across sessions, such as by integrating a database or file system storage. Finally, I would consider adding additional features, such as support for recurring appointments and email notifications.
